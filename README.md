# Vector-Field-Pathfinding-Implementation-in-Unity
Implementation of Vector Field based path finding made for using in conjunction with Steering behaviours 

Code was based on this article:
https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-goal-based-vector-field-pathfinding--gamedev-9007

The method for avoiding the Local Optima problem was taken from :

Currently I can generate The vector field and factor in obstacles into the cakculation. I'll implement steering behaviours soonish.
